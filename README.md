# Asteroids_Game
A simple bottom-up implmentation of Asteroids. 
You fly through space and try to shoot the asteroids before they hit you.

The only outside source used is the short helper library "hl.js", created by /adeshar00.
All game concepts implemented here (gravity, roation, collision etc.) were derived from scratch (whiteboard brainstorming) and/or foggy memories of the 10th grade physics class.
