# Asteroids_Game
A simple bottom-up implmentation of Asteroids. 

The Game: you fly through space and try to shoot the asteroids before they hit you.
- The only outside source used is the short helper library "hl.js", created by /adeshar00.
- All game concepts implemented here (motion vectors, gravity, rotation etc) were derived from scratch (whiteboard brainstorming) and/or foggy memories of the 10th grade physics class.

TODO:
- reduce redundancies
- clarify variable names and use
- periodically clear bullet array
- don't let player exit the canvas
- improve syntax
- HTML/CSS embellishments
- allow user to input variables such as asteroid number and other constraints via the browser
- make asteroids split upon collision with bullets
